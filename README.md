The game will store questions and answers in a file. When you run it, it will 
ask the questions and check your answers against those in the file. At the end 
of the quiz, it will tell you how many questions you got right. It will also allow 
you to add new questions and answers to the quiz file. When you run the game, you 
will be presented with a menu with the following options: the first option to ask 
questions; the second to add a question; and the third to exit the game. If you 
select option 1 to ask questions, the game will display each quiz question in turn, 
asking for the answer to each one. When you give an answer, the game will indicate 
whether it's right or wrong before moving to the next question. After all of the 
questions have been answered, the game will display how many out of the total number 
of questions asked that you got right. It will then return to the main menu. If we 
select option 2 to add a question, the game will prompt the user for the question 
and the answer, and it will append these to the questions file. It will then return 
to the main menu. Finally, if we choose option 3 then the game will simply shut down.
